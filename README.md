# CameraTrap360
These are simple code files for using two PIR motion sensor to trigger and Arduino to trigger a 360° camera, the RICOH THETA.

The step-by-step Instructable to make your own hacked 360 camera that gets triggered when something passes by and capture a whole spherical image of the entire scene are detailed in this Instructable: https://www.instructables.com/id/360-Camera-Trap/ 

From the developer Andrew Quitmeyer: This is the very first prototype of mine to get playing with 360 traps, so it’s a bit rough, but future improvements with the USB API (for less invasive hacking), and switching to waterproof cameras will make really durable awesome cameras you can rely on!

From the description:

Full 360-degree camera traps can open up lots of new avenues of exploration for scientists and nature lovers! Capturing the full photosphere around the camera can help remove “placement bias,” and let the camera venture to places other cameras couldn’t go (like dangling up in the canopy!). I’ll show you how to make your own, with lots of fun examples with monkeys and GIANT LIZARDS!
